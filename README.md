# Google Book Search

This is an API search engine refactored through a MERN stack with React as a front end, MongoDB database, and Express server with GraphQL and Apollo.

[Depoloyed App](https://booksearchturner.herokuapp.com/)

Starting with a allready working app, I refactored it from a RESTful API into the MERN stack and connected it to a MongoDB cloud based database. In this app, users can sign up and search for books through a google api and save them onto their own list. This list is saved in the database so a user can log out and return at another date and find thier saved books.
